# HPC_Edge_AI
created an openCL based heterogenous server for edge ai applications as a part of PES-CIE internship 2023.

# Refer to the python notebook to view the implementation of the scheduler. Detailed results and reports can be found in the project report.
Created a custom hardware platform consisting of intel integrated graphics card and Nvidia Quadro M1200 GPU. Task are scheduled using weighted round robin approach keeping load balancing in mind.

Requirements to run the notebook: 
Dell Precision 5520 workstation with integrated graphics card and Quadro M1200 GPU.
